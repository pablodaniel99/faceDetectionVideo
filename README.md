# Embedded Faces <a name="embedded"></a>
#### The first script that I'm going to explain is the first one to be executed, which is "embeddedFaces". The first thing wee need is to have and import this libraries:

```python
import sys
import cv2 
import face_recognition
import pickle
```

#### As I explained [on other project](https://github.com/pablodaniel99/detectFaces/blob/main/README.md#maybe-you-have-some-problems-importing-cv2-it-is-highly-recommended-to-use-virtual-studio-code-why-because-usign-this-platform-will-make-the-installation-of-this-package-way-more-easy-than-using-conda-o-pip-which-not-only-could-provoke-an-error-but-may-also-last-2-hours), you maybe have some problems installing "face_recognition".




# Recognice Faces <a name="recognize"></a>
#### The second script and last one script is the one executed in order to detect the faces recorded on the last script, for that mission, this libraries are necessary:
```python


```
